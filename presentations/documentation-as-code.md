# Documentation as code

[Write The Docs](https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/docs-as-code/)

> Documentation as Code (Docs as Code) refers to a philosophy that you should be writing documentation with the same tools as code.

--

## What tools do we use?

- Code editor / IDE,  
  e.g. IntelliJ, VS Code, vim, Notepad++
- Version Control System, e.g. <i class="fa fa-git"></i>
- Issue tracker, e.g. Jira

# The idea behind documentations

Why should you write something down in the first place?

--

## Bad reasons for documenting

- It's required by a higher force.
- It's the only way to know what the thing does.

--

## Things you could do instead of documenting

- Write clean(er) code
- Automate more

--

### My view on writing things down

<span class="fragment">It's a way of communication</span>
<span class="fragment"> ... with other people you may never meet</span>
<span class="fragment"> ... or even your future self.</span>

<span class="fragment">So I'd like them to be thankful for what I told them.</span>

# Text files vs. nice looks

- <i class="fa fa-git"></i> + IDE → text files
- text files ≠ fancy layouting

--

## Conventions to the rescue

- semantic text files
  - simple structure based on conventions
  - can be published to various formats <i class="fa fa-html5"></i> <i class="fa fa-file"></i>
- [Markdown](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), [Org-Mode](https://orgmode.org/), [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/)
